# Fractal Compass + CDDA Core

A recursive symbolic engine for exploring deep conceptual patterns across multiple domains using glyphs, mandalas, and cross-domain reasoning.

---

## What is This?

This is a prototype tool that:
- Builds symbolic trees using glyphs and domain logic
- Blooms recursive structures to explore meaning
- Uses a Cross-Domain Discovery Algorithm (CDDA) to generate insights
- Translates patterns into questions and conceptual bridges

It’s meant for:
- Pattern seekers
- Cross-disciplinary thinkers
- Recursive weirdos
- Anyone who’s ever thought “this symbol feels true in *multiple* systems”
-

## Example Use

```python
theme = "Inversion is required before transformation"
domains = ["Biology", "Mythology", "Thermodynamics", "Psychology"]
result = run_cdda(theme, domains)

result:

THEME: Inversion is required before transformation
CONFIDENCE: 82%
SCOPE: Learning, Healing, Species Evolution
NEXT QUESTIONS:
- What triggers inversion?
- How does time alter the transformation arc?
